# Installing Flexi
Installing Flexi is an incredibly simple process, and can be done in two ways:
- (Recommended) Using Unity's package manager to install the most up-to-date version of Flexi
- Manually downloading the version of Flexi you want from the releases page

## Unity Package Manager
Installing with the Unity package manager is the recommended way to install Flexi
- Visit the [Flexi store page](...)
- Add the Flexi package to your assets
- Head over to your Unity project
- Open the package manager (Window -> Package Manager)
- At the top of the package manager you may see "Packages: Unity Registry," "Packages: In Project," "Packages: Built-In" or "Packages: My Assets." If this menu is not set to "Packages: My Assets," click the dropdown menu and select it
- Scroll through your assets until you see "Flexi"
- Click the "download" button at the bottom and wait for it to finish downloading
- Import the files into your project

## Manually Installing Flexi
This installation method is not recommended as you must manually download and install Flexi each time you create a new project or a new version is released
- Visit the [release](https://github.com/NathanPease16/Flexi/releases) page for Flexi
- Download the release you would like (".unitypackage" file)
- Import the unitypackage file into your project
- Double click the file and import the Flexi package

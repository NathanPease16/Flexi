## Description
Determines how the interpolation will move. If a [FlexiKeyFrame](../FlexiKeyFrame/FlexiKeyFrame.md)'s Rate is set to `time`,
it will complete the interpolation between itself and the next key frame over a set amount of time, regardless of how much
distane it has to cover (time is constant). If its Rate is set to `speed`, it will move at the same speed during its interpolation, regardless of how much distance it has to cover (speed is constant)
